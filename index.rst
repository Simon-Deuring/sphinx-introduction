Welcome to Sphinx!
==================

Sphinx is a documentation generator that can also be used to generate blogs, websites, and books. For this, reStructuredText files are translated into HTML pages or PDF files. This tutorial will show the first steps to create a Sphinx documentation and is based on https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html.
