# Welcome to this guide about Sphinx!

Sphinx is a documentation generator that can also be used to generate blogs, websites, and books. This project shows you the first steps to get started with Sphinx. Moreover, the guide itself was created using Sphinx, so you can see all described reStructuredText directives in action.

Before you start you need to install Sphinx on your local machine as described [here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html). Then you can clone this repository and build the documentation using `make html` from the shell. This command generates an HTML page under "_build/html" which you can open with a web browser of your choice. The Sphinx guide looks like this:
